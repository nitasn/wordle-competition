## C++ Wordle Solver

A (much) faster version, written in C++.

Using a `Word` class that wraps a `uint64_t`, and exposes an `operator[]`. No pointers / indirections involved.

## Todo

1. Precompute `compareWords(Word guess, Word secret)` and use a look-up table.

2. These cases occur:

```
Guessed TARES and got ğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
Guessed SPITE and got ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
Guessed SHITE and got ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
Guessed SKITE and got ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
Guessed SMITE and got ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
Guessed SUITE and got ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

After getting ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ© for SPITE, 
wasn't there a better word to guess? something with the letters HKMU?

If setting the secret to FIGHT and fixing the first guess to LIGHT, the game goes like:
```
Guessed LIGHT and got â¬œğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
Guessed ABERS and got â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
Guessed KNOWD and got â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
Guessed FIGHT and got ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

If setting the secret to EIGHT and fixing the first guess to EIGHT, the game goes like:
```
Guessed LIGHT and got â¬œğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
Guessed ABERS and got â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œ
Guessed EIGHT and got ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```
